# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


This is the basic description about my Project 'Amar Bari'

1. Secure Authentication: Your website offers a seamless and secure login and signup process powered by Firebase, ensuring user data protection and easy account management.

2. Smooth Deployment: Deployed on Netlify, your website benefits from fast load times and reliable hosting, providing users with a top-notch browsing experience.

3. Engaging Animations: With animated banners and routes, your website captures visitors' attention and provides a dynamic, interactive browsing experience.

4. Detailed Property Cards: Detailed and animated property cards showcase real estate listings in an appealing and informative way, helping users make informed decisions.

5. User-Friendly Interface: The website's clean design and intuitive navigation make it easy for users to explore and find what they are looking for quickly.

I've also used 
1. AOS package for animation
2. SwiperJS for slider
3. Animate CSS for route Animation
